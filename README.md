The app was setup in AWS that used images, scaling and a database.
The two images, Twitter_Stream & TrumpTweets, used node.js to carry out the code

Twitter Stream was essentially just an image that funnelled all tweets made after its creation into a database 
where it would store the twitter user, post text and the sentiment score. It was intended to be used after three
days after its creation in order to accumulate a number of tweets.

Trump Tweets setup a website that just showed the average sentiment score, the most recent tweets and a phrase he
might say according to the sentiment score (how the population feel about him).

The current existence of Trump Tweets is off since continuation of use requires upkeep with fees.
